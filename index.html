            <p>My name is Natalia Malcova and I am originally from Moldova. I speak a variety of languages including, besides English, Russian and Romanian.</p>
            <p>I graduated from Northern Virginia Community College with an AAS in Administration of Justice and subsequently from George Mason University with BS in Criminology, Law, and Society.</p>
            <p>In addition, I have an extensive professional experience in bridal dress'styling and alterations. I aspire to learn coding in order to become a high-class specialist who can combine her education in Criminal Justice with the skills in software development.</p>
            <p>When I am not glued to the computer styding, I really enjoy watching interesting movies and TV programs along with my family and also like to be active outdoors going for long walks with my dog.</p>
